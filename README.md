## *Why did I move here? I guess it was the weather...*
This is section to address all those who have read till here . If you are a fan, comrade it's nice to have you here and I know thatjust like me you might be waiting for GTA 6, so in that mean time you can add your awesome contributions like adding new data and new gta games making this website dope.
If you are someone who haven't even seen a game from this series, you have no idea what you are missing and I would personally recommend you to play a game from this series, infact complete the game, download mods, play online with friends and join the community for the wait of GTA 6.
And Fially I know there are a lot of things I can add but this is about GTA, a game series that has a lot of information that the more you add in the webpage the lesser it feels , that is why I have kept it open for all GTA fans in open source community to add into this website.
